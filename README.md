# Firer Sans

A subset of [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) version 4.202, respaced with
[HTLetterspacer](https://github.com/madig/HTLetterspacer/tree/reduce-better) and without
kerning, because it looks fine as is. I find the original's spacing and kerning wonky
(and [Fira Sans Go](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FiraGO) doesn't fix it), so I made my
own for drop-in replacement use.
